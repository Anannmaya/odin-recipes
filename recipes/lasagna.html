        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a delicious Italian dish made by layering cooked pasta sheets with rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, and mozzarella. The sauce is made by simmering ground beef or sausage with tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. These layers are repeated in a baking dish and topped with extra cheese before baking at 375Â°F (190Â°C) until golden and bubbly. Let it rest before serving for the perfect slice. Enjoy with garlic bread or a fresh salad!
